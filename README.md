hi friends! thanks for taking an interest in the work that I have done - I really appreciate it!
  (1) to view my projects, kindly download the files in "week 3 tutorial challenge"
  (2) next, open one of the files called "index.htm" in the folder you just downloaded on chrome.
  (3) that should bring you to my nm2207 webpage, which contains the links to all of the projects and assignments I have done over the course :D
thank you once again and enjoy! <3
